The WLAN Pi Go is a small WiFi analysis tool built around the CM4 and an Intel BE200 WiFi module, which snaps onto the back of an iPhone with Magsafe. It uses a short USB-C cable for power and a local network connection, which apps on the iPhone use to analyze the local WiFi environment.

The hardware can also be used with apps on Mac or Windows for WiFi and spectrum analysis (the latter of which requires a docked Oscium Clarity or Lucid spectrum analyzer, which attaches to the back).
